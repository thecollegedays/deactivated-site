<h3 class = "parish-title">Portland</h3>
            <p class="parish-content">Portland is a parish located on Jamaica’s northeast coast. It is situated to the north of St Thomas and the east of St. Mary. The parish is known for its natural beauty, stunning beaches, lush vegetation, multiple caves and rivers as well as the peak of the Blue Mountain range. It lies in the direct path of the prevailing northeast trade winds that bring rain, and its hilly terrain trap the winds and ensure almost daily rainfall.</p>
            <p class="parish-content">Portland, a combination of the parish of St. George and part of St. Thomas, was named after the Duke of Portland who was a Governor of Jamaica between 1722 and 1726. The Maroons who lurked in the Blue and John Crow Mountains were adamant that Europeans would not settle in Portland. They got all their firepower by raiding plantations or purchasing from mercenaries. The 1730s saw a series of battles between the Maroons and the British.  When it seemed that the Maroons were about to destroy Portland, the British captured Nanny Town, the Maroon settlement whose leader was the woman who would later become Jamaica’s first National Heroine – Nanny.</p>
            <p class="parish-content">Portland is known for its vast contribution to the country’s agricultural output, especially in the cultivation of banana, coconut and breadfruit for both the domestic and foreign markets. Most of its coastal strip has been designated as land suitable for cultivation with almost no limitation. No other agricultural land has been attributed with this description in Jamaica.</p>

            <h3 class = "parish-title">St. Thomas</h3>
            <p class="parish-content">Sweeping down from the serene height of Blue Mountains to the pristine coastline of south-east Jamaica, the parish of St. Thomas is one of the most storied in the island. It is bordered by St. Andrew on the west, Portland on the north and the Caribbean Sea to the south.</p>
            <p class="parish-content">Long before modern-day Jamaicans inhabited the parish, other peoples moved among the forests and grasslands of St. Thomas. The history of human settlement in the parish stretches back as far as 650 AD when the Taino people reached our shores. Archaeologists have unearthed Taino settlements at Spanish Wood, Retreat, Belvedere, Cambridge Hill and Yallahs. But little is left of these early settlers apart from their graves, some pottery and the refuse they left at their dump sites, called middens.</p>
            <p class="parish-content">Evidence of the country’s economic role can be seen in the settlement pattern of the parish. The first Spanish settlers in St. Thomas established cattle ranches at “Morante” (later to be called Morant Bay) and at Ayala (now Yallahs).</p>

            <h3 class = "parish-title" id="standrew">St. Andrew</h3>
            <p class="parish-content">St. Andrew was one of the first parishes in Jamaica to be established by law in 1867. Before being established, it was known as ‘Liguanea’, the Taino word for iguana. St. Andrew lies to the north, west and east of Kingston. As Kingston grew in popularity wealthy residents of Kingston began buying old “pens” in St. Andrew.  “Pen” originally referred to a farm where livestock was kept, and until recently, many areas in St. Andrew were still called pens.  “Pen” soon came to be considered a derogatory term for places where people lived and many of these pens were renamed “gardens”.</p>
            <p class="parish-content">St. Andrew stretches from Cross Roads to Rockfort in the east, and reaches up into the Blue Mountains, sharing borders with St. Thomas, Portland, St. Mary and St. Catherine.  Overlooking Kingston and St. Andrew, the Blue Mountains reach as high as 1,930 metres at Sir John’s Peak within the municipal boundaries.</p>
            <p class="parish-content">The fan-shaped Liguanea Plains rise from sea level to the foothills of the Blue Mountains. St. Andrew along with the parish of Kingston has a total coastline area of 64.37 kilometres, with the total area of shoreline (usable coastline) being 48.8 kilometres.</p>

            <h3 class = "parish-title">Kingston</h3>
            <p class="parish-content">Kingston, the capital of Jamaica, is the smallest parish yet the most populated city on the island.  It faces the 7th largest natural harbour in the world that is protected by the Palisadoes, a long sand spit which connects the town of Port Royal and the Norman Manley International Airport to the rest of the island.</p>
            <p class="parish-content">Kingston was founded in July 22, 1692, on Colonel Barry’s Hog Crawle as a refuge for survivors of the earthquake on June 7th which had destroyed two-thirds of Port Royal. Prior to the earthquake, Port Royal was the headquarters of the English buccaneers and was known as the “wickedest” city in the world because of the riotous life of the town’s inhabitants including the likes of privateer, Sir Henry Morgan.</p>
            <p class="parish-content">The new town was bounded on the south by Harbour Street while East, West and North Street defined the remainder of Kingston.  The original grid pattern of Kingston remains the same today except for a few additions.  The additional streets were named after the councillors at the time when the town was founded.</p>

            <h3 class = "parish-title">St. Catherine</h3>
            <p class="parish-content">St. Catherine was created in 1867 when four smaller parishes were joined together, and is named for Katherine (Catherine) Queen of Charles II. <br/>
            The parish has long been a site of human settlement. The pre-Columbian Taino lived there followed by the Spanish, who made their capital at St. Jago de la Vega (present day Spanish Town).  Today, St. Catherine is the second most populous and the most rapidly growing parish, with large manufacturing and agriculture industries. The Office of the Registrar General is still located in Spanish Town, as is the historic Emancipation Square.</p>
            <p class="parish-content">The capital town, Spanish Town once the capital city of Jamaica in the parish of St. Catherine has the finest collection of historical buildings, and the country’s archives.  As a site of historical importance, its history was shaped by its experiences within two significant colonial periods.  These periods are: the Spanish from 1534 -1655 and the English from 1655 -1782.</p>
            <p class="parish-content">The Mandela Highway, a four-lane roadway connects Spanish Town with the country’s capital, Kingston. Portmore is connected to Kingston by a section of Highway 2000, a 23-kilometre tolled motorway which connects Kingston and Ocho Rios to Montego Bay, sections of Hanover, Westmoreland, Manchester and St. Elizabeth. </p>

            <h3 class = "parish-title">Clarendon</h3>
            <p class="parish-content">Clarendon was named in honour of the Lord Chancellor Sir Edward Hyde, Earl of Clarendon. One of Jamaica’s youngest parishes, Clarendon was formed from a combination of three parishes: St. Dorothy’s, Vere and the old parish of Clarendon. Before the merger, its capital was Chapelton.</p>
            <p class="parish-content">Prior to the arrival of the Spaniards and the English, the Tainos, Jamaica’s indigenous people, lived on Portland Ridge [now called Portland Point] (the part of the parish that juts out into the sea).  Taino villages could also be found on the banks of the Rio Minho River, the island’s longest river, with the other villages on the banks of the Milk River.</p>
                        
            <p class="parish-content">Clarendon is also home to the Caribbean’s largest agricultural show: Denbigh Agricultural Show. For over 50 years Denbigh, an official Jamaican Independence activity, has been held every August for three days to celebrate Jamaica’s wealth of domestic and agricultural product.
            </p>
            <p class="parish-content">Clarendon is located at the southern side of Jamaica, roughly halfway between the eastern and western ends of the island.  It is bordered on the north by St. Ann, on the west by Manchester, on the east by St. Catherine and on the south by the Caribbean Sea. Clarendon is predominantly a wide plain, lying between the Braziletto Mountains in the east and the Carpenter Mountain (The Manchester Highlands) in the west.</p>

            <hr class="parish-separator"/>
            <h3 class = "parish-title">Manchester</h3>
            <p class="parish-content">On November 29, 1814 at the beginning of the 19th Century, coffee farmers in the hill districts of Clarendon, St. Elizabeth and the then parish of Vere, petitioned to have a separate parish established. They asked for a new parish, with a capital which would meet their religious, civic, judicial and administrative needs. The main reason for this action was the vast distance between the hill districts and the commercial and administrative centres of all three parishes.</p>

            <p class="parish-content">On December 13, 1814 the new parish was formed and named after the Duke of Manchester who was then serving as the Governor of the island. The capital was named Mandeville, after his son and heir.</p>
            <p class="parish-content">In the days prior to the abolition of slavery, Manchester’s population was never as large as that of the surrounding parishes because the hilly terrain was not suited for the cultivation of sugar which was then the island’s most lucrative crop. However, after emancipation many of the newly-freed slaves moved into the area to grow coffee and other crops on hillside farms.  In the old colonial regime, Manchester had the prestigious distinction of being the most English of Jamaica’s parishes and it was known as “the playground for the landed European gentry”.</p>

            <p class="parish-content">In 1942 it was discovered that Manchester was the site of one of the largest deposits of bauxite in the country.  Bauxite is a red ore which is processed to produce alumina and eventually aluminium.  This discovery led to the growth and development of Manchester’s bauxite and alumina industries which facilitated the speedy development of the parish and Mandeville in particular.</p>
                            
            <p class="parish-content">Today, the economy of Manchester is still deeply rooted in both bauxite and agriculture.</p>
            <p class="parish-content">Manchester is located in south-central Jamaica. To its east is the parish of Clarendon while St. Elizabeth lies to its west and Trelawny to its north. It rivals its neighbour Trelawny for the title of Jamaica’s most mountainous parish. The three main ranges running throughout the parish are the Carpenters Mountains, the May Day Mountains and the Don Figueroa Mountains.  Of the three ranges the Carpenters Mountains is the highest, reaching as far as 2, 770 feet above sea level.</p>

            <hr class="parish-separator"/>
            <h3 class = "parish-title">St. Elizabeth</h3>
            <p class="parish-content">St. Elizabeth is one of the oldest parishes in Jamaica.  Originally including much of the western section on the island it was split to form parts of Westmoreland and Manchester in 1703 and 1814 respectively. St. Elizabeth was named in honour of Lady Elizabeth Modyford, wife of Sir Thomas Modyford, Governor of Jamaica between 1664 and 1671.</p>

            <p class="parish-content">Early settlement in St. Elizabeth began in the Pedro Plains where the Tainos, the first known inhabitants of Jamaica, occupied the coastline and lead a simple life. Though the original Tainos died by the 17th century, persons of Taino descent from Surinam came to settle in the parish in the 18th century and their descendants are there to this day.</p>
            <p class="parish-content">Though the social scene has changed significantly, the parish has forged ahead in agricultural production, providing the bulk of Jamaica’s vegetable and fruit provisions. The Black River supports an important shrimp and freshwater fishery. And best of all, St. Elizabeth’s diverse geographical patterns make for a landscape as rich and varied as the heritage of its people.</p>
            <p class="parish-content">St. Elizabeth lies to the southwest end of Jamaica, bordered on the north by St. James and Trelawny, on the south by the Caribbean Sea, on the west by the parish of Westmoreland and on the east by Manchester. The northern and north-eastern sections of the parish are mountainous, while an extensive plain occupies the central and southern districts. Running through this plain from north to south is the Santa Cruz range of mountains which terminates at the southern extreme with a 1,600-foot precipice.</p>

            <hr class="parish-separator"/>
            <h3 class = "parish-title">Westmoreland</h3>
            <p class="parish-content">Colonists named this parish Westmoreland in 1703, after the English took over the island from Spanish rule in 1665; it is likely that it received its name as it was the most westerly point of the island. Savanna-la-Mar, the capital, was developed as a port from which sugar was exported and dates back to around 1730. The Spanish name Savanna-la-mar means “plain by the sea” and refers to its environment. One of the first Spanish settlements was also built at present-day Bluefields in this parish.</p>

            <p class="parish-content">The parish boasts rain-fed fertile soils and low relief, well suited for sugar cane. The town of Frome, located some 5 miles away from Savanna-la-Mar, is one of the few remaining sugar factories in the country. In 1938, riots at the Frome sugar estate changed the course of Jamaica’s history. In the wake of these riots, the legislature passed universal adult suffrage in 1944, as well as a new constitution, which was approved by the Crown. This act put Jamaica on the road to self government and eventually independence.</p>
            <p class="parish-content">The fertility and lush vegetation of the parish is greatly maintained by the various rivers and streams that are important sources of water. The popular Great Morass, found in the parish, is a large swamp area, which covers thousands of acres. Plant and animal material have collected on this land over the centuries and is thereafter mined as peat – a great source of energy.  The wetlands, common to the parish of Westmoreland, serve as a natural sanctuary to Jamaica’s wildlife.</p>
            <p class="parish-content">Westmoreland, located at the west end of the island, is adjoined on the north by the parish of Hanover and on the East by St. Elizabeth and St. James. The parish has a combination of white limestone, marl, sand, gravel and coral reefs.  Lying on the Georges Plain, the parish is drained by the Cabaritta River.</p>

            <hr class="parish-separator"/>
            <h3 class = "parish-title">Hanover</h3>
            <p class="parish-content">Jamaica’s second smallest parish, Hanover was established in 1725 and was named for the reigning monarch on the British throne, George I, who was from the House of Hanover in Germany. The capital town, Lucea has been known by many names and stretches along the western side of a horseshoe-shaped bay, which is considered to be one of the island’s safest ports. From the hills overlooking Lucea Harbour, one can observe an expansive panorama of the bay. Similarly, the view from the Dolphin Head Mountain provides an extensive vista of the other parishes in the western side of the island.</p>
            <p class="parish-content">Hanover sometimes does not get credit for its beauty and charm, and is often overshadowed by the nearby tourist destination of Montego Bay. Nevertheless it shares the Negril strip with its southern neighbour Westmoreland and many of the rich and famous tiptoe into the parish at the Round Hill Hotel and the Tryall Beach and Country Club thinking that they are still in Montego Bay.</p>
            <p class="parish-content">Hanover rounds off the north-western tip of the island. It lies to the west of St. James and to the north of Westmoreland. The capital, Lucea, is situated on a beautiful harbour 25 miles west of Montego Bay and midway between Montego Bay and Negril.</p>

            <p class="parish-content">The highest point is Birch Hill (1810 ft or 550.2 m), followed by Dolphin Head (1789 ft or 543.8 m). Numerous caves, coves and bays mark the coastline of Hanover.</p>

            <hr class="parish-separator"/>
            <h3 class = "parish-title" id="stjames">St. James</h3>
            <p class="parish-content">St. James was one of the second group of parishes formed in Jamaica and is said to have been named by Sir Thomas Modyford in about 1655, for the Duke of York (who later became James II and was the reigning monarch at the time). It was, however, much larger at the time as it included what are now the separate parishes of Trelawny and Hanover.</p>
            <p class="parish-content">Additionally, the parish capital of Montego Bay was witness to the final act of slave uprising in the island prior to emancipation. Known as the Christmas Rebellion of 1831-32, it began at Kensington Estate and engulfed the entire western section of Jamaica. Led by Baptist preacher and leader Samuel Sharpe this rebellion provoked two detailed Parliamentary Inquiries, which arguably contributed to the 1833 Abolition of Slavery across the British Empire.</p>
            <p class="parish-content">Positioned on the north-west end of Jamaica, St. James is a suburban parish bounded by Trelawny to the east, St. Elizabeth to the south and Hanover and Westmoreland to the west. Stretching from St. Elizabeth, the Nassau Mountains extend diagonally across St. James, ending in hills at a point south of Montego Bay.</p>

            <hr class="parish-separator"/>
            <h3 class = "parish-title" id="trelawny">Trelawny</h3>
            <p class="parish-content">Established in 1770, this parish was named after William Trelawny former Governor of Jamaica.

            Trelawny has pockets of rich culture indigenous to the parish. The southern section of Trelawny is a part of the Cockpit Country, and is uninhabitable. It is therefore a natural reserve for flora and fauna; most of Jamaica’s 27 endemic bird species can be found there, along with yellow snakes, and the giant swallowtail butterfly, the largest butterfly in the western hemisphere.</p>
            <p class="parish-content">Wakefield in North Trelawny is the home of the Tambu, Gerre and Mento Band. The Jamaica Cultural Development Commission (JCDC) has taught these traditions to children in several schools –Duncans All-Age and Granville All-Age. Drumming is also a part of the rich culture and was one of the teaching activities of JCDC.
            <br/>
            With new attractions such as the Falmouth Cruise Ship Pier and the Multi-Purpose Complex, Trelawny is receiving well-deserved notice by tourism interests as it positions itself among the most attractive locations in the very competitive industry.</p>
            <p class="parish-content">Trelawny is bordered by the parishes of St Ann in the east, St James in the west, and St Elizabeth and Manchester in the south. Most of the parish is flat, with wide plains such as Queen of Spain’s Valley, and Windsor. The highest point in the parish is Mount Ayr which is 3,000 feet (910 m) above sea level.</p>

            <hr class="parish-separator"/>
            <h3 class = "parish-title" id="stann">St. Ann</h3>
            <p class="parish-content">St. Ann was named after Ann Hyde, wife of James II, King of England and is recognized as the largest of all the parishes. It is known as ‘The Garden Parish’ for its bauxite, agriculture and livestock production and – perhaps most notably – its tourist attractions.
            <br/>
            The parish is believed to be the earliest Taino/Arawak settlement in Jamaica. When Christopher Columbus first came to Jamaica in 1494, he named the actual spot at which he first landed Horseshoe Bay, because of the peculiar shape of the land. This was changed to Dry Harbour and eventually, a final, more appropriate, name change was made to Discovery Bay.</p>
            <p class="parish-content">Given the continuing influence of St. Ann natives Bob Marley and Marcus Garvey worldwide, and with the lingering traces of the Spanish occupation and Taino settlement, St. Ann is well known as a repository of Jamaican culture and history.</p>
            <p class="parish-content">Situated on the north coast of the island, St. Ann is bounded on the east by the parish of St. Mary, and on the west by the parish of Trelawny.  It shares its southern borders with the parishes of St. Catherine and Clarendon. The dominant range is the Dry Harbour Mountains, but individual peaks such as Mount Diablo, Mount Alba and Mount Zion are prominent. On the plains, the soil type is predominantly limestone, which, along with the many rivers, gives rise to numerous caves and sinkholes. Some 60 caves have been noted throughout the parish, of which the most famous is the Green Grotto, in Runaway Bay.</p>

            <hr class="parish-separator"/>
            <h3 class = "parish-title" id="stmary">St. Mary</h3>
            <p class="parish-content">St. Mary is well known for being one of the first sections of the island to be occupied by the Spaniards. In 1655, after the English captured Jamaica from the Spanish, the area around the town of Puerto Santa Maria became known as St. Mary. Port Maria, the current capital of the parish was the second town built by the Spaniards on the island. Today, this parish includes the former parish of Metcalfe and part of the former parish of St. George. Numerous national monuments still stand in the parish such as the town of Rio Nuevo which holds historical significance for being the site of the last battle between the invading English and the defending Spaniards who eventually had to flee to Cuba.</p>
            <p class="parish-content">With the decline of sugar, banana cultivation took its place. In the late 1930s, St. Mary played a prominent role in the creation of Jamaica Producer’s Association which was set up to prevent the continuation of the monopoly on bananas held by the United Fruit Company and other purchasing organisations. Under the umbrella of the Association, the Jamaica banana growers banded together to ship and market their own produce.</p>
            <p class="parish-content">The parish of St. Mary is bordered by Portland in the East, St. Ann in the West, and parts of St. Catherine and St. Andrew in the South. It is mostly mountainous, rising up to almost 4000 feet at the highest point with just under 13 per cent of its area having slopes below 10 degrees. There are three (3) main rivers in St. Mary: the Rio Nuevo River, Wag Water and White Rivers. These rivers are often slow, and at times create swamps in the surrounding area.</p>
